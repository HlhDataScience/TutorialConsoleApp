# TutorialConsoleApp

A simple C# console application that demonstrates the basics of the C# programming language. This project is designed for learners who want to explore core C# concepts through hands-on examples.

## 🚀 Features Covered

This app walks through a variety of fundamental programming concepts:

- ✅ Printing to the console
- ✅ Variables and data types
- ✅ Math operations
- ✅ Exception handling (`try` / `catch`)
- ✅ Number conversion
- ✅ Comparison operators
- ✅ Logical operators
- ✅ Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- ✅ Switch statements
- ✅ Loops:
    - `for` loop
    - `while` loop
    - `do...while` loop

## 📂 Structure

All the code is encapsulated within the `TutorialConsoleApp` namespace and executed in the `Main()` method, which sequentially runs demonstrations for each feature.

Each feature is implemented in its own static method for clarity and modularity.
